The script "OFDMvsCosModTMUX.m" is adapted from https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/examples/f-ofdm-vs-ofdm-modulation.html. It compares the performance of OFDM to cosine modulated TMUX.

The script "FBMC_OFDM.m" is adapted from https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/examples/fbmc-vs-ofdm-modulation.html. It compares the performance of OFDM to exponentially modulated TMUX (FBMC).

The script "reverseEngrApproach.m" illustrates the design examples in the Appendix.

The script "win2Prototype.m" generates the prototype filter from some window in the reverse engineering approach.

The script "diffFromPowComp.m" measures how much the starting-point window differs from PC with equations (13), (22), and (23) in the report.

The other scripts that start with "fig" are used to generate all plots in the report.
