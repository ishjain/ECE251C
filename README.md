# ECE251C: Filter Banks and Wavelets by Prof. Truong Nguyen, Fall 2019

## Analysis of Filter banks for Multi-carrier communications
```Ish Kumar Jain, Zhaoxin Hu```

### Abstract
Multi-carrier modulation with Orthogonal Fre-
quency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is being used in 4G cellular system and it provides higher data rates compared to
previous single-carrier systems. However, OFDM suffers from
higher side lobe leakage which limits the spectral efficiency.
Various filter banks based on DFT and DCT modulation have
been studied to solve this limitation. In this report, we compare
the performance of these filter banks and analyse various design
tradeoffs. A ”reverse engineering” approach is proposed to design
the prototype filters of DCT-based filter banks. These filter banks
generally have higher complexity compared to OFDM, but have
better spectral efficiency which is required for many applications
such as cognitive radios and OFDMA based multiple access
system.
